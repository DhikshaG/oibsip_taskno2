# Car Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the price of cars. The price of a car depends on various factors, including the brand's reputation, car features, horsepower, mileage, and more. Car price prediction is a significant research area in machine learning, with practical applications in the automotive industry.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various cars, including their attributes such as:
- Brand reputation
- Car features
- Horsepower
- Mileage
- And more

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features as necessary.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features and create new features if needed to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection**: Experiment with different regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
5. **Model Training**: Train multiple models using the training data and evaluate their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected models to improve performance.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models' performance on the test dataset to select the best-performing model.
8. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model to predict car prices based on the provided features.
